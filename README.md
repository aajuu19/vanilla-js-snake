# Vanilla JS Snake

I haven't written vanilla js in a long time, since I usually use React and Typescript to build my projects. I just wanted to see if I could still write vanilla js, so I decided to build a simple snake game. Actually I never coded a snake game, so i thought it would be a good idea to try it out. I set myself a timeframe of 4 hours to build this game. It was a fun experience. Obviously the code can be improved on many levels, but looking at the timeframe i had, i am happy with the results.

## How to play

Open the `index.html` file in your browser and start playing.
Attention: Sound is enabled by default (and there is no option to turn it off ðŸ¤“).

- Use the arrow keys to move the snake
- Eat the food to grow
- Don't hit the walls or yourself
